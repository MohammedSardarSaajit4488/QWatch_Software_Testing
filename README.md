# QWatch Pro Reverse Engineering & Testing

üß≠ This beginner-level QA project explores how to reverse engineer and test an Android smartwatch companion app ‚Äî QWatch Pro ‚Äî focusing on customizing watch face presets and validating app stability post-modification.

---

## üß™ What I Did

- Decompiled the original `QWatch Pro.apk` using **ApkTool**
- Explored the resource structure (`res/`, `assets/`, `drawable/`, `layout/`)
- Identified and replaced preset watch face images with custom images
- Edited XML layout file `fragment_watch_face_diy.xml` to bind new assets
- Rebuilt and signed the APK for safe installation
- Installed and tested on emulator/device for behavior, stability, and UI
- Wrote manual test cases to validate functionality

---

## üõ† Tools Used

- ApkTool
- Android Debug Bridge (ADB)
- Visual Studio Code
- Java (APK signing)
- XML, Smali
- Real Watch & Emulator for testing
